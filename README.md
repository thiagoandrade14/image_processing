# Description #
This project, implemented in the summer of 2019, reads TGA files that contain binary data of images and load them as objects. Once loaded, the driver program (main) can manipulate the images in a variety of ways, such as blending two pictures together (in two different modes), applying color filters, or rotating it in 180 degrees.
